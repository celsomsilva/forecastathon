## Code Availability

To preserve the integrity of ongoing and future Forecastathon seasons, 
implementation details are not publicly released during active participation.

After the competition period, I’m open to discussing the modeling approach 
and selected implementation details with recruiters or technical leads 
in a private, context-appropriate setting.
