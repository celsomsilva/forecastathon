## Code Availability


To preserve the integrity of ongoing and future Forecastathon seasons,
implementation details are not publicly released during active participation.

This repository is intentionally focused on results, decision-making behavior,
and modeling philosophy, rather than full code disclosure.

After the competition period, I’m open to discussing the modeling approach and
selected implementation details in private, context-appropriate conversations
with researchers, practitioners, students, or hiring teams interested in
forecasting markets and applied statistical modeling.
